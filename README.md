This library is compatible and made for Minecraft Java 1.20.2, I don't think I will support older versions nor Bedrock Edition.<br>
You can still create your own fork and make it compatible with older versions.<br>
I will accept pull requests for older versions on a separate branch.

## Getting Started

You can't currently download the library because it's not finished yet, but you can still clone the repository and use it as a local
library.

Then, you can create a new project and add the library as a dependency.

## Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
	val datapack = dataPack("test") {
		function("display_text") {
			tellraw(allEntities(), textComponent("Hello World!"))
		}

		recipes {
			craftingShaped("enchanted_golden_apple") {
				pattern(
					"GGG",
					"GAG",
					"GGG"
				)

				key("G", Items.GOLD_BLOCK)
				key("A", Items.APPLE)

				result(Items.ENCHANTED_GOLDEN_APPLE)
			}
		}

		function("tp_random_entity_to_entity") {
			val entityName = "test"
			val entity = allEntities(limitToOne = true) {
				name = entityName
			}

			summon(Entities.CREEPER, vec3(), nbt {
				this["CustomName"] = textComponent("Hello World!")
			})

			execute {
				asTarget(allEntities {
					limit = 3
					sort = Sort.RANDOM
				})

				ifCondition {
					score(self(), "test") lessThan 10
				}

				run {
					teleport(entity)
				}
			}
		}

		pack {
			description = textComponent("Datapack test for ", Color.GOLD) + text("Kore", Color.AQUA) { bold = true }
		}
	}

	datapack.generate()
}
```
